Python sample application for wercker leveraging the Flask
microframework

To run the application, make sure you have the [wercker cli installed with it's proper requirements](http://devcenter.wercker.com/learn/basics/the-wercker-cli.html).

Once you have all that set up, you can start the application by running `wercker dev --publish 5000`. 

This will run your application inside your Docker host. The `wercker dev` command will tell you the address and port you can find the application on.

If you have any problems or questions with running the project, don't hesitate to open a new issue!

Note: this sample application only runs on the Ewok stack (version 5) on wercker
